Uploaded - Pre Release Stage

08. 18. 2022
@1132 Made many tweaks to the site design, almost 'completely' release ready
	however the imageview experience is currently having issues on iPad
	apparently it's viewport isn't a true 1024 x 768 thus I have to switch
	around the breakpoint rules.

08. 14. 2022
@2254 emailJS finally implemented and working!
	few tweaks to make for ipad, but.... she ready T- T

@1332 implement emailJS. Last ish thing :D

@1248 it seems like the 'final', tasks here are to:
	- implement emailjs
	- fix UIE and CTA sizes and animation ✅
	- imageview image size on desktop ✅
	  - add text on desktop ✅


08. 13. 2022

@1724 reimplemented loader when selecting gallery,
	may only have it apply to collabWork gallery for now,
	the others load too fast

@1701 Loading for allImages seems to be working.
	Have to add it back for selecting gallery,
	which I could swear I already freaking did?!

	prod not updated yet

@1623 
	Also fix how the UIE conforms on desktop
	scale down images in imageview on desktop
	add span to menu within imageview thats only visible while on desktop
	loading needed before allImages can be rendered

@1130 Need to fix the next button,
	  loading needs to be readded to the gallery selection
	  emailJS for contact form

@1126 more or less officially have seperate repo for the production site. 
	  Process will be that we work on any changes here, and then copy 
	  whatever files we've worked on over to the prod.
	  git copy the prod repo to mah laptop
	  May have the images in the local dev link to the copies within
	  the dev version

08. 12. 2022
@2040 selecting an image from all image opens imageview properly.
	  Edit the 'next' function for when allImages is open

	  properly relinked all images

@1340 Halfway done with the allImages section
      need to images to properly open up imageview onclick

      and make corrections for next when allImages is open

08. 10. 2022
@1942 Had to fix quite the bug, but the new gallery object is connected and quite fast.
	  gotta find way to remove context menu from thumbnails and that weird highlighting...that only seems
	  to happen for the first few albums...?


08. 08. 2022
@1201 Created a production git repo on the site, and a branch locally, for the production version of the site.
	  I dont even wanna think about managing that rn, but when the build is ready for launch,
	  ill merge this main with the production branch. 
	  I can then remove the unwanted stuff from the main branch, like the images.
	  (I dont think github will be too mad at me for storing around 3GBs worth of images on it ....
	  pretty sure it did before, before I removed it)

	  Anyhow, the readImagespathTwo file prints the gallery object to a .js file.

	  To Do:
	  - Now just need to plug everything in: have the gallery images pull from the created file, link to it
	    in the HTML ✅ 08. 10. 2022
	  - have the other images on the site rerouted as well
	  - add the last functions to the gallery:
	    - the object to check whether a section or album has been opened previously, (no need)
	    - allImages 
	    - the next section button (no need)

	  and then finally plug in email.js :D

	  and the copy for thePhotog in selfConception

@1042 getting all the images - gotta make sure the string names are actually right now (._. )

08. 07. 2922
@1936 Working on script to automatically get all images and create gallery object
		- need to add getting thumbnails + allImages

08. 06. 2022
@1219 Worked through mostly all the issues I'd written about in offline,
	  but now there's some more stuff :D

	  - Need to add back functionality for allImages
	  - Need to write copy for 'The Photographer' section
	  - What to do when section already preloaded, and reopening it?
	    - loader pops up and wont go away
	    ?! Create check for when a gallery has been opened, within the currentGalleries object

08.04.2022
@2203 Conceptually, we are much closer to the preloader implementation working 100%
	  The promise isn't returning correctly for render gallery.
	  Would probably see the loader properly implemented launching imageview otherwise

	  if I need to, can reupload all the photos at lower resolution,
	  create lil script to parse the links correctly

	  or, I can create seperate thumbmail versions instead...

	  also have to find some way to make sure the albums append to the page in order...
	  may include adding a date element to objects

	  also, stop bubbling when selecting images to swipe in imageview

	  find way to remove that horrid highlighting when selecting an album D:

@1207 project successfully porting images over from Google Drive - however the load times are absolutely abhorrent

08. 03. 2022
@1644 Implemented the loader :D Now, to test implementation of hosting images in Google Drive D:
	  *add 'click and drag to left' message for desktop view within imageview


@1108 As of some time this morning, the site is unofficially up :D ! It's being hosted with Netlify, and they're a pretty swanky 'free' hosting solution. 

Current rather simple yet long to implement obstacle is hosting these images someplace that's not github. I gotta do my due dilligence and make it somewhat difficult for people to be able to snatch my high res photos. 

First, ive actually gotta add my logo to ... all of them T- T
Then, uploading to GDrive in a new folder, specifically for them.
It would seem I then have to individually get the link for each image, 
and then add it to the respective gallery.
I should figure out how to implement the preloader into this...
And then have to design/implement a loading thing





07. 31. 2022
@1257 contact form needs to be reduced in width...
	  sideButtons[0] needs desktop and mobile queries
	  sendMessage needs resizing on mobile

@1228 Button for cycling through testimonials is now completed

07. 30. 2022
@2318 wrote sudo code for back to options button
	  - finish it, then 'next slide' function for button in testimonials

07. 28. 2022
@1919 Set up HTML & CSS for testimonials section
	  Get 2 other testimonials !

	  To do:
	  - JS for slider functionality
	  - Back to Option functionality
	  	- can appear for both Social Media Bar and & Form


07. 26. 2022
@1155 Mostly completed styling and JS functionality for email form
	
	  To Do:
	  - Add glitch effect to submit button
	  - create button for returning to initial options

	  - Create testimonials slider 
	  - integrate email.js functionality (once ready to upload site)


07. 24. 2022

@1135 Begun contact form ...

@0945 Add tooltip to image in imageView stating that user can drag image from right to left
and vice versa to cycle through images
	Issue with vertical images on desktop T- T

07. 23. 2022
@2150 Begun JS for transmission section,
	  built out social media links section
	  function for closing optionsWrapper 


@1415 Begun working on Transmissions Section
	  HTML & CSS done for initial options

	  To Do:
	  - new JS file for section √
	  	get all elements as consts
	  - selecting any option prompts optionsWrapper to "close" state √
	  	- set styles to 'close' element √
	    - optionsWrapper then scales and reopens to size of whatever
	      element appears (different classes for each element)
	  - subElements:
	    Instagram/Twitter box √
	    Testimonials slider
	    Contact form
	  - include 'back' button that returns section to initial options

07. 06. 2022
Some user feedback from Lily
- Being prompted to click the UIE could be made more obvious. Wait longer for it to appear
or add some text around it.
	- Menu selection after UIE, it isn't as apparent that the options are in fact options.
	  perhaps make the menu selections smaller, condensed. Seem more button like
  - make titles for albums more button like as well

07. 05. 2022

@1106 preloader implementation currently not working as intended :/
	  gots to further assess situation

@1031 implemented preload function into render, however it may not even make a difference
	as the the rest of the script doesnt take images from the new array created by the
	preload function.

@1116 Preload needs to happen upon gallery selection, right from the start.
	  Scale up causes the scroll to reset?
	  And, in portrait mode for tablets images in imageView should be smaller -
	  imageView also isn't changing styles when in landscape orientation either
	  (has to do with max-height query)

	  aaand for initial gallery choice, black boxes covering background images need to
	  be bigger xD

	  iPad has text color for active links (in nav menu)
	  navMenuOptions is also too low on iPad 

@1046 Issue with the navbar fixed :D 

07. 04. 2022
@1900 The merge seems to have gone well, for the most part. However, now having issues 
	with nav elements reappearing after opening menu

	current object is to have nav corners dissappear in both mobile and desktop.
	corners currently dont return in opacity after menu being opened and closed again

@1812 For reasons unknown to me, code fom the galleryRework branch seems to have made it
	  over into the main branch. I know now the extent of the breach (lol)
	  Or, maybe not? I dunno, working on the merge rn

06. 06. 2022
@2121 Issue fixed. Site now remembers user's last section upon page refresh.
	  Next thing to work on, gallery redesign.
	  Thumbnails images for each gallery load upon selecting gallery,
	  wait until they load, then albums appear domino style.
	  would include running function to get first 3 images
	  out of all albums.

	  or, load each album's images then load button to select album

	  add support for vertical images by allowing page relayout on rotate 
	  (different viewport)

@2014 Giving me errors that I don't understand can be possible. Declared elements
that were fine are suddenly not, despite not being touched at all...

@1748 Soooo with the preload being utilized, it seems that the site has trouble
	  loading on mobile (._. ) I can't even refresh

	  May have to implement the loading images before entering each specific 
	  gallery now...

	  Might as well do the redesign now as well T- T

@1152 Display the close button for nav in desktop mode as well...
@1144 As of now, it works exactly as it should 
	(though whether the images are actually saved in session storage is another issue, as it's near 1GB of images...)

@1105 IT WORKS !!! 
	  For now, will launch the preloader for all images when the site first loads.
	  Will eventually for it for each album or gallery.

06. 05. 2022
@1442 it works :D Now time to implement....

@1428 Currently working on functionality that waits until all images loaded, to then load the UIE. Have to make sure all images are actually loaded and, checked, and that the UIE loads after, not before. 
in the middle of working through it...

needs to await 
	let pic = testLoadImage(img);
within the for loop

05. 29. 2022
@1422 Fixed thumbnail sizing in gallery
@1402 Added jpgs for Boston Photo Album, removed another album I no longer
	  care to host on the portfolio

05. 28. 2022
@0942 Wrote function to preload all images.
	  Need to convert images from Boston Photo Journal and
	  Cars and Pussy from ARW to JPEGs. Was abit lazy concerning that...

05. 27. 2022
@1711 Added new logo code to index.html
	  Fixed issue with nav button being maladjusted on mobile.

05. 15. 2022
@2130 At which point in the UI experience / sequence should the images be set to preload?
	  Perhaps at site launch: Replace UIE with 'Loading Site Assets...' until images loaded

	  Can use gallery[x].allImages as array to get all image files
	  use 'var x = new Image()', then assign img.src with path from array 
	  loadedImages will simply exist as cache for images

	  
	  Also, styling in gallery may still need to be adjusted for larger displays

05. 13. 2022 Friday the 13th :D
@1822 Adjusted text within selfConcept section, much more legible now. 
	  Adjusted font styling of arrival section menu as well.
	  Fixed various styling issues within gallery section, thumbnail
	  images issue and nav. 
	    - need to fix issue with header and main nav not having background
	      color within this section.

	  To Do, 
	  - Cache all images before launching gallery.
	  - TRANSMISSIONS SECTION (ugh)

05. 11. 2022
@1609 Fixed sizing for arrival section elements and nav elements, mobile
	  Fixed issue with nav background being remaining black after leaving
	  gallery section. 

	  Still need to re do text for about section 
	  - also haven't written content for 'the developer' 

	  Set all images on site to load before displaying site 
	  - would need to assign all images to elements in an array using async 	or await, then proceed to load site after it's completion.

05. 09. 2022
@1137 Fixed
	  - Work on Arrival & SelfConcept resizings
	  - begin planning gallery reWork

@1100 Fixing issue with images in SelfConcept section rotating wildly

@1000 Attempts to get LAN server running on WSL failed (._. ) - with the
	  intentions of being able to view the site on my mobile devices of course.

	  Was able to install and get up and running Node and the Server on Windows
	  itself successfully!

	  And the site is viewable over mobile!!!

	  . . . there's quite a bit of work to do

05. 05. 2022
	
@2243 Adjusted some styling in arrivals section, fixing issues in rendering 
		across different viewport sizes. UIE, title.
		Also, finally fixed the issue with the media queries which adjusted
		the photos within their wrapper T-T
		Turns out the solution was simply implemented incorrectly (minor error)

		Animation of the UIE is still sticky however.

		Next Section of things to work on: Navigation. 
		For some reason, the hover function i originally designed for mouseover
		on the menu button isn't working. May need redesign

@2040 Wait until running portfolio off node to adjust font size styles for arrival
	*implement block (pop up model) for when viewport dimensions fall outside 
	acceptable parameters (like a phone being in landscape mode)


05. 04. 2022
@1529 Worked on landing section - finally fixed the carousel!!!
	 - need to adjust media query function for the images within it
	 - set runTheCarousel.set and .repeat within index,
	   .cease whenever user leaves arrival
	    - .repeat takes a while to start, factor that in

	Have alot of other things to fix on landing, will document
	necessary fixes later...

	04. 04. 2022
	@2346 Practicing pushing / pull updates across different accounts 
	- from Laptop


<--- S I T E  U N I F I C A T I O N

	03. 01. 2022
	@1249 Uploaded to git! Great, now I get to practice 'git-in' again :D
		  Must remember to update git whenever I add changes 

	@1221 Now working in new folder and preparing project for upload on Github.
	      - as the images are quite large, will exclude them from upload

	@1217 Background photos need to be weworked: periodt
		  Gallery nav bar needs to be redone so that height encompassed 
		  all children. Currently does not, and background looks funny
		  when scrolling over albums

	@1152 
		To Fix: Gallery
		- Gallery nav bar and header should be static on top of page (fixed)
		- Nav bar too big in mobile
		- Background pictures dont resize well in mobile, currently
		- Bottom of album list gets cut short (fixed)
	
	03. 01. 2022
	@2044 Added "Gallery" section to index.html and begun reorganizing gallery.js.
		Some minor issues to fix, overall integrated fine (for now)
		(Will definitely have to redo the navigation for the galleries...
		 Not very intuitive at all . . .)

	02. 26. 2022
	@1133 after spending some time researching a node tutorial, I've decided to indeed finish putting everything together, and then pivoting to take some to explore and learn Node. It seems as though it'll take some time for me to hop around in 'tutorial hell' to find / learn it. 

	@0925 For now, gonna prioritize getting everything we have together and preparing for a github upload and hosting over node.js
	Once that is done, development can continue in terms of whatever tweaks and later, upgrades, need to be done / added


	02. 25. 2022
	@1230 "Disabled" nav menu option once viewing corresponding page, now works!
			fixed some issues with the nav in mobile form

	02. 24. 2022
	@1708 Begun adding function so that menu option is 'disabled' after selecting
	      it / being one it's respective page. 
	      Works once leaving the landing section (arrival) but not after...

	02. 23. 2022
	@1414 Added functionality to arrival menu options - that works fine
		  but slow down transition
	    
	    -  Some kinks to work in regards to using nav within site sections
	      also, header and nav spacing from edges slightly messed up?

	    - arrival UIE still 'snaps' together too quickly
	    - Images fading in and out smoothly, timing propably needs to be adjusted
	    - Switch which menu option has 'disabled' when viewing it's respective section [DONE]

	02. 22. 2022
	@0520 Begun integrating all pages together.
		  Cleaned up landing.js and began to organize, so that I can use export/import when site goes live, channeling control of all scripts through
		  one main script

		  Added functionality to sectionSelection() so that it operates differently
		  when used on arrival section

		  To Do
		  - add sectionSelection() toggleHeaderHav() to arrival menu items
		    ( arrival should be fully functional )
		  - allow clicking on header to return to arrival section
		    ( switching from arrival to another section should revert
		      arrival to original form )

		  *Integrate rest of sections, clean up their code

<!--- P R O J E C T  N O T E S : A B O U T

	02. 17. 2022
	1549 Site Navigation now functional!
		 After adding all other section content to index.html,
		 will need to create function for 'default' section settings,
		 for when users switch sections mid usage

		 To Do
		   - Add rest of section content
		   - Mobile styling for Navigation
		   - Transition function from landing section to section selection
		   	 - could function selectSection be modded to fit both usages?

	02. 16. 2022
	2207 Begun putting all of the pages together. 
		 Laid out some intentions for nav function designs

		 still need to edit nav stylings for mobile

	02. 15. 2022
	@1413 Styling complete for About section.
		  IMHO, CSS order and labeling scheme needs to be cleaned up.

		  Next to do:
		  - Combine all 3 sections + filler page for contact into 1 index.html

		  - Organize CSS between all 3 sections

		  - Build out rest of Nav functionality
		  	- Set Nav to switch between light and dark for different sections
		  		- unify header and nav css


		  After this is complete, plans are to upload to Github and use as template
		  to begin learning Node.js.

	02. 14. 2022
	@1440 Have worked on project a couple more times before today, but forgot to make entries
		  Significant progress on 'About' section

		  Need to:
		  - adjust text size within div.contentWrapper for tablet sizes (768px)
		    and then adjust positioning for sibling elements
		  - Also need to adjust image expansion size + 'the Developer' image 
		    needs to stay in place when expanding (it currently shifts to the right)

		  1024 and below will be considered a mobile styling, atleast
		  for the Nav bar. 

	02. 08. 2022
	@1159 Function for toggling text created.
		  "Simply" need to work on mobile styling (ipad and phone)

		  Afterwards, COMBINING EVERYTHING TO GEH THHHEER

	02. 07. 2022
	@0003 Started working on function to switch text content
		  Need to find way to have textWrapper be same size as largest paragraph,
		  and or hide the others, only to appear when called

	02. 06. 2022
	@2102 Edited hover animations for each side.
		  Open and close functions created and added for content

	02. 03. 2022
	@2041 All elements added in JS
		  sidenote, made use of classed ;D Feeling accomplished

	01. 29. 2022
	@1024 Side note for future build - preload images before rendering gallery section

	01. 28. 2022

	Implement JS functions. First, get all elements.
	Then describe algortithms for functions (design of transitions)

	a build. ( consistency will improve . . . ) 


<!--- P R O J E C T  N O T E S :  N  A  V  I  G  A  T  I  O  N

	12.14.2021
	@1551 Added simple version of section names in nav bar.
		  Font needs to be adjusted for phone, mobile view

	@1320 Navigation transitions up to par.
		  Need to disable it once image viewers are active, but this something
		  to implement once entire project is pulled together.

		  For "Demonstrations" button, that goes to gallery,
		  set all divs within this section to have class 'remove',
		  so that the section is reset, only the main menu appearing

	12.13.2021
	@1500 Made some additions concerning the mobile version of nav
		  issue with background color of nav transitioning nav menu page
		  need to find new implementation ....

	@1357 Currently in dev, remember to disable navigation while within galleries

	12.10.2021
	@2050 Transition added for buttons upon menu toggle

		  To Do:
		  - Media query (will possibly adjust size of elements for tablet view)
		    redefine span.corner
		    style changes for span.menu-active
		    (will have to use keyframes to style changes)

		  - would like to add an effect of a line running through the text upon click

	12.09.2021
	@2148 Menu now functional. Need to add animation for buttons after
		  menu div appears. Will have them slide to the left from the
		  corners. Also implement this effect in reverse

	12.08.2021
	@2203 Put some work into menu . . .
		  As of now, would like to see the 
		  - corners expand (scale and margin)(middle one rotates) as
		  	the menu activates (display, opacity)
		  	  * use JS for menu activation, class control



	12.02.2021
	@1938 Begun work on Navigation Menu
		  Hover function works to denote current active sections

		  To Do:
		  - Would like a spaghettification affect
		    with the words 
		  - modal overlay with the menu options
		  - Nav to be sticky in place

		  ?! Can add function to transition between
		  	 pages AFTER 'About Me' is complete

		 To Do:
		 - ABOUT ME PAGE !



<!--- P R O J E C T  N O T E S :  G  A  L  L  E  R  Y

	11.29.2021
	@2054 No work towards project tonight:
		  Outlining next goals:
		  - Navigation function 
		  - i GUESS an "about me" page

		  	the "about me" & gallery +(landing) will be the only two parts for now
		  	will work on and add contact later...

		  - reLearn Git to upload project there
		  - then, eventually, the contact section (forms ARENT that bad...)

		  * would also like to fit in learning about and setting up das server

	11.28.2021
	@2110 P r e t t y M u c h finished with mobile styling.
		  will need to give project another check for anything else missed,
		  seeming 90% complete at this point

		  Will need to run project on mobile screen sizes
		  to ensure mobile styling is adequate

	11.27.2021
	@2125 Worked on mobile styling for mainMenu (complete)
		  and section#album
		  - need to implement style that works for when
		  	all images in thumbnails are horizontally long

	@1940 All images that aren't RAW are now accessible 
		  Also added some new ones

	11.23.2021
	@2037 Made UI changes to the imageViewers....
		 Would like to make sure all photos are accessible before 
		 going on to media query

	@1430 Changed hover animations for albums UI controls.
			Would still like to change controls for photoViewer as well

			TBH, might redesign both imageViewers (._. )

	11.22.2021
	@2341 fixed some styling to the UI controls for viewing albums and viewALL
		  Dont like how they currently look tho
		  May add additional element, 50% in width, with open border.
		  Might make the hover affect look cooler, i dunno.
		  Possibly utilize css after psuedo class

		  Mobile styling should be worked on soon after.

	11.20.2021
	@2224 CSS styling for main Menu added 
		  (wasn't able to implement 100% as originally designed, but satisfied)
		  Styling adjusted for album selection
		  (may adjust further)

		  FIX
		    - many of the images/folders are either
		      not named correctly
		      or
		      not a jpg

		  To Do
		    - continue CSS styling
		    - mobile styling . . . D:

	@1436 Added thumbnails of first few images from albums to div.entries.
		  Currently feeling iffy about the styling tho . . .

	@1247 Now everything actually works smootly :D

	@1210 viewAll buttons now work as intended :D

	11.16.2021
	@2103 viewAll back and next buttons work, however class changes/animations
		  dont seem to be.
		  Also need to add if statement to cycleFoward and backwards,
		  for when viewAll is up, to change the update the current span 

	@2242 Finished adding the code for albumNext.
		  All nav works as intended :D

	@2211 (Almost) completely implemennted viewAll :D !!!
		  Just need to add more code to albumNav_Next, √
		  so that when all images are being viewed, it transitions properly
		    - clicking it should also advance the currentGalleries.all as well
		    - Will have it revert back to div.entries, instead of leaving allImages up

		 AFTER - NEXT
		   - viewAll controls
		   - complete intend styling, based off of initial designs
		     ( unsure whether to implement preview of first images....)
	
	11.15.2021
	@2221 Moved Modal prompt to better position
		MEXT: added some css for it already,
			 finish implementation for viewAll images

	11.14.2021
	@0031 Consider alternate styling for viewAlbum, with removed header,
		  alternate widths already in css

	@0011 Technically, it's the 15th.
		  Fixed all the UI issues :D

		  viewAll needs to have section with every image loaded,
		  selecting an image prompts viewAll gallery with current
		  image loaded

	@1626 Main Menu for galleries is now operational, 
		  but many UI issues to fix
		  - order of menu options and galleries within the JS dataset is not aligned √
		  - viewAll button? Have gallery name switch to say 'view all' on hover, 
		  	is also button to view all √
		  - return button should bring us back to mainMenu √
		  - next should cycle to next album √

		  ALSO
		  - rePosition the prompt button within gallery √
		  - viewAll functionality √
		    (for viewAll counter, can simply set innerHTML of counter to index)

	@1554 fancyGallery functions assigned 
		  Also made adjustments to code, so that gallery traversal works as intended

	11.13.2021
	@1843 all functions for counter created. 
		  NEXT: 
		  - simply need to assign the object functions to other functions √
		    within renderGallery and the gallery controls.
		  - rePosition the prompt button within gallery
		  - viewAll functionality
		    (for viewAll counter, can simply set innerHTML of counter to index)

	@1632 Adjusting the timing for the gallery control functions have helped _s o m e w h a t_
		  The images being used are still in large file sizes, however...

	11.12.2021

	@1607 Added transition for cycling through images. 
		  - need to add class for viewAll_img as well
		  - the transition gets a little finicky when used often, try adjusting
		  timing in css and JS to fix

	@1529 Created modal, added functions for 'return to gallery' and closing it.
		  Modal prompt needs to be moved somewhere much more stylish (._. )
		  Add viewAll functionality to modal once it gets created

	11.11.2021
	@2052 Solution found :P Was honestly a stupid problem - just added the
	control functions, but didn't aaaign them T- T.
			N E X T: make the image count tracker work :D √
					 add animation for image transition (timing should line up with image tracker) √
					 return button pls √
					 viewAll functionality... (have the images load row by row)

	@2045 working on second half of render function,
		  can't assign functions for viewAlbum ui within a forEach loop.
		  have to find different way of dynamically reassigning them

	@1706 About 2 SOLID hours of work done.
		- created functions for operation gallery buttons
		- 1/2 of renderGallery function created

	@1507 for some reason, must use arrow function when using .addEventListener

	11.09.2021
	@1210 Fixed extendAblums so that file names are written correctly
		NEXT: create functionality for viewAlbum

	@1146 Gonna have to rename photo galleries (._. )

	@1135 Realizing now that the image names created aren't complex enough.
		  Also need to design viewAlbum and viewAll functionality first.

		  But so far,
		  have added CSS toggling classes √
		  function to add/remove main sections within this part of project √

	@0953 Today's goals:
		  - Add css toggling classes for larger HTML sections and divs
		  - Add 'return to gallery' buttons for viewers 
		  - Begin writing functionality within JS (mainMenu to album with
		    corresponding data);

	11.08.2021
	@2053 All HTML Elements now have JS Counterparts.
	NEXT : add 'return to gallery' button in nav section in galleries for now
		 : begin writing functions for ... everything
			- creating and writing to album entries,
			- removing / changing current element (need to create transition classes)
			  for those elements T- T
			- code for updating the counters within the galleru naviations

	@2027
	album.appendChild() is needed to add album entries 
	current 'albumEntry' template is a template lol. Will probably use it with
	object.create() within other functions

	@1353 Basic styling complete for all elements.
	As per previous entry today, styles will need to be consolidated, 
	and the overall designed compared to the original intended
	NEXT: create exit button for each gallery type (add prompt page later)
		 creating the JS element counter parts

	@1306 Will have to consolidate styling rules, have elements with similarities
	share styling

	@1129 Finished styling for viewAlbum 


	11.07.2021
	@1414 Working on remainder of HTML elements
	would like to complete basic styling for all elements today
	and begin create JS counterparts

	11.06.2021
	@1154
	Added more elements + styling to the page
	To Do (eventually)
	- spacing between elements and font sizes DEFINITELY need to be adjusted
	  for mobile

	11.05.2021
	@1022
	Added some initial styling and elements to the page
	I really ought to start working on this EARLIER during the day D:

	Next steps would be to design & set up the layout for
	- albums,
	- viewAlbum,
	- viewAll

	11.04.2021
	@0017
	Technically started this since....around 9?
	But successfully wrote code to create organized data sets of the gallery.
	Objects with albums, those albums having their own images, and a collection of all
	the images within an object

	11.02.2021
	@0125 Spent a v e r y long time working on designing an organization
	of data for the galleries.
	Did organize the folders, however.

	11.01.2021
	@1952 Thought I would be able to implement my ideas for the full gallery
	part of the site with just basic JS. I am not :/
	Have to reconsider how much of this site I intend to build out with just 
	Front End. 
	Have to come up with ideas for implementation

	!? Maybe have each gallery in individual folder, (extra gallery for those without)
	then, array with "x.jpg" for however many amount of images in said gallery.
	Probably an object with function that writes out each img file name based on a property value of length, amount of images

	Another function that could then make array of all the images in each category,
	extracting them all from each object in said category

	use practice20 for help with design of function to go through nested arrays

	will have to reorganize images in folders...

	11.01.2021
	@1903 spending additional time on this stressed me D:

	@1841 'fixed' an effecting timing issue with the UIE by decreasing
	the amount of time it takes to spin around. Dunno how I feel about it...
	But it looks more cohesive

	@1807 Removed 'mouseover' function from script,
	simply added the classes it was handling by default to the UIE parts.
	Solves the first part of the issue. 

	10.31.2021
	@1558 CAROUSEL STYLING FOR MOBILE COMPLETE !!!
	Landing section still has some kinks to work out 
	  - the UIE compresses weirdly on click (will probably have to
	  remove event listener for mobile)
	  - UIE shape is funny when clicked again after first click (mobile)

	Project 90% complete :D !

	@1602 
	Yeah we need to change event listeners at for mobile....

	@1339 images now adjust properly for different widths :D
	Gotta remember to have 'else's for your 'ifs'
	also, decorator functions only work if original function takes arg
	remember to be open when reading docs and tuts in looking for a solution
	sometimes they'll tell you the ideal solution were thinking of doesnt work

	10.30.2021
	@2308 Spent too much time trying to fix dis shit
	Make if(mediaQuery1024) a function, have it run on page load
	and every time the carousel switches the images.
	should fix our issue. 

	@2156 Begun adding mobile styling for carousel, however images are
	not adjusted well within element size limits. Will most likely need
	to make images background images instead, so that they can be adjusted

	could potentially use object-position property to make adjustments...

	@1955 Believe I have now edited all text related, UIE and Logo elements
	to acceptable styling for mobile widths and smaller desktops

	10.29.2021
	@2219 Continued working on further styling adjustments
	for text elements, logo and UIE - yet may actually need
	to use local host in order to see this on mobile for
	actual viable styling

	Will work on vertical styling for carousel next...

	10.28.2021
	@2102
	Media Query / Mobile Styling TaskList ....
	√ Made styling adjustments for section#menu, logo and UIE
	  ( will need to further verify design on a mobile device)
	- Vertical styling for carousel
	  - need to make new transition classes for movement
	     - change animation values for those corresponding elements
	     	within the media query. Define the keyframes outside of
	     	the query

	10.25.2021
	@11:12pm
	last thing, MEDIA QUERIES !
	afterwards, this part of the project should honestly be complete

	  √ added 3d(ish) glitch affect to menu text

	√ Adjusted the animation times for UIE, title text and carousel

	Planning for adding Media Queries:
	* loadUp_ and LoadDown_ classes need to have query
	  for mobile. The images will be vertical, thus will need to slide
	  that way
	* menu items vertical instead of horizontal 


	10.24.2021 
	L A S T  S T E P S 
	√ adjust animation speeds ( UIE animates faster than elements change )
	√ hover affect for menu options (the whole div will be the button)
	- media queries

	@10:49
	- UIE is functional: switches title and carousel to logo and menu

	@10:05pm
	spent most of the evening trying to find way to stop 
	carousel from running, as it will contine to make changes 
	to the DOM.
	Was unable to.

	N E X T 
	- Make UIE functional:
		*when clicked, carousel *stops* and disappears,
		 menu appears

		*should also work in reverse

	- hover affect for menu options (the whole div will be the button)
	- media queries

	@3:05pm
	- section.Menu created
		* all inner elements styled

	@2:12pm
	- created function to switch title text with logo
		*will adjust animation times after menu

	@ 12:20
	- Cleaned up JS and adjusted animation times for header and UIE


	10.23.2021
	- Added fonts to css
	- Added Icon and header text to html
	- Converted Icon graphic from Adobe Xd file to SVG
	( had to spend some time thinking about the best implementation of this)
	N E X T
	- on page load, animations for header text and UIE (could be done in css)
		- header text, UIE, then carousel
	- create new section.Menu with links to other portfolio sections and descriptions
		- functionality for UIE to change section from Carousel to Menu
			- on switch to menu, cease carousel's js
			- on switch, header text switches place with logo


	10.22.21 @ 11:58pm
	- Resized and cropped images
	- wrote script for and implemented carousel
	E V E N T U A L L Y
	- find way to cache images, so that they load faster initially
	  ( or maybe make them even smaller in size T- T)
	- Reverse animation for imgWrappers - once they move in a direction,
	they move in reverse from that direction, instead of restarting
	N E X T
	- add header text
	- initial site load sequence 
	( header fades in, images, and then UIE)
	- UIE function to change 'section' to menu section


	10.21.21 @ 8:20pm
	- Tonights intention, add the images to the html,
	- perhaps make arrays within script

	@ 10:42pm 
	- added initial images
	- changed images name within folders
	- fixed css and added JS for imgWrapper to match original, intended design
	- added array for images
	N E E D  T O
	  - resize images to be smaller,
	  - crop 2nd and 3rd images to match design
	  - write out script for carouselling

	10.20.21 
	@9:46pm
	- divs are regaining opacity too quickly for my liking

	@ 9:36pm
	-created css classes & animation keyframes for div.imgWrapper 
	-added initial classes to html


	@ 8:21pm
	/* 
		img wrappers load with class that has animation by default.
		set a timer for a few seconds, then check whether wrappers have class.
		if true, replace class with another - which has outgoing animation.
		another delay. if img is first in set, remove - add second img. then
		reset imgWrapper to have original class. 

		this repeats, cycling through all the images 
	*/

	10.19.2021 @ 7:47pm
	Added base styling for showcase, the sections and the image wrapper
	!? Need to design JS + CSS sequence for the animation

	10.18.2021 @ 6:44pm
	Added initial HTML markup for images 
	Stated intention for the design and current implementation idea
	added images to project folder for usage


	10.18.2021 @ 1;32am
	came up with an acceptable solution

	@ 12:47am
	Gonna have to reevaluate design with the UIE....

	10.16.2021 
	@7:22 
	PERSEVERING THROUGH THE DAY AND TASK the UIelement now smoothly animates
	as intented.
	N e x t T a s k: on click, 'compress' corners into box, while wrapper
	continues to rotate(?)

	@ 11:43am
	Upon hovering over wrapper, each span element within in it gets a
	css styling which causes them to move inward.
	Once no longer hovering over the wrapper, this styling is gone
	and the elements revert to original positions.

	10.14.2021 @ 7:08pm
	Would like to implement additional animation for UI element where the corners
	slightly close in on eachother when the wrapper is hovered

	10.10.2021 @ 8:52pm 
	Solution implemented:
	have angle elements be inline block and sized relatively to
	wrapper element - solving the sizing, posisiton and reference issue.
	To progress 2moro...

	10.10.2021
	Design intentions for the UI button aren't currently going as seemlessly as thought.
	- wrapper element isn't rendering with any width, and thus not properly orienting in
	the center
		- also leads to the issue of not having one central element to corresspond to the
		others, as wrapper is technically, spacially 'empty'
